#there is non linear relationship between both variables

# 2.  Use the animals (see below)dataset to 
# put the data on a log scale and 
# find that it looks much better. 
# As you know the  I or AsIs function does something 
# like the opposite of the tilde operator. 
# It tells the interpreter to go ahead and 
# evaluate the enclosed expression. 
# The general gist is to transform our data to 
# log scale then apply linear modeling. 
# As you remember in the tutorial we have y ~ x + I(x^2), 
# where the operator I(x^2) evaluates x^2 before using it in a formula.
